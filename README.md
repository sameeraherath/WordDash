# Word Guessing Game

A fun and interactive word guessing game where players have 10 minutes to guess the hidden word. Players can request hints to help them guess the word, but each hint reduces their score. If the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of time, the game ends.

## Features

- **Timer**: Players have 10 minutes to guess the word.
- **Guesses**: Players start with 5 guesses. Additional guesses are earned by using hints.
- **Hints**: Each hint reduces the player's score by 10 points, and provides a clue about the hidden word.
- **Scoring**: Players start with 100 points. Using hints deducts points, while incorrect guesses donâ€™t affect the score.
- **Sound Effects**: Correct and incorrect guesses, as well as hints, trigger sound effects to enhance the experience.
